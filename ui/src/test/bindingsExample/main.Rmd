## Binding Test

This is an R Markdown document to test the o2r Binding function. It provides a simple Plot where the horsepower of different Cars is scattered against their 1/4 mile time. Additionally the linear regresion is shown.

We have two parameters to change:

1. The number of cylinders the cars is allowed have. By all it juses all cars, other options are 4, 6 or 8.
2. The minimum miles per Gallon. So cars can be excluded, that need to much energy.



```{r, out.width= 600}
data("mtcars")
numberOfCylinders = "all"
minimumMilesPerGallon = 4

if(numberOfCylinders == "all"){
  cars= mtcars 
  } else{
  cylinders = as.numeric(numberOfCylinders)
  cars = subset(mtcars, cyl == cylinders)
  }

cars = subset(cars, mpg > minimumMilesPerGallon)


fm <- lm(cars$qsec ~ cars$hp)
plotFigure1 = function(cars){
  plot(cars$hp, cars$qsec)
  abline(fm, col="red")
}

plotFigure1(cars)


```
